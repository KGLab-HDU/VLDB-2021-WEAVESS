CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    G:/MinGW-w64/boost_1_73_0

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at G:/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/CLion/ch-0/202.7660.37/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Boost) does
  not match the name of the calling package (BOOST).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
